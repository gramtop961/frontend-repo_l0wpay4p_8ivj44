            I am an architect focused on modern residential and small commercial projects. My work is guided by luminosity, material honesty, and a deep respect for context. Each project is an exercise in restraintâ€”crafting calm, enduring spaces that feel inevitable rather than imposed.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-neutral-700 leading-7">
            Over the past decade, I have led renovations, new builds, and adaptive reuse projects across urban and coastal sites. I collaborate closely with clients, fabricators, and builders to ensure that concept and detail align from sketch to site.
